🔦 Beam Search Algorithm for Informed Graph Traversal
This project implements the Beam Search algorithm — a heuristic-based search strategy that balances breadth-first search (BFS) and greedy best-first search, allowing efficient traversal through large graphs by exploring only the most promising options at each level.

🚀 About This Algorithm
Beam Search is designed for situations where the search space is too large to explore completely. Instead of evaluating all nodes at each level, it only keeps the top-k best candidates (based on heuristics) — significantly improving speed and memory usage.

✅ Combines the structure of BFS with the focus of Greedy Search
✅ Limits node expansion using a predefined beam width
✅ Trades off completeness and optimality for efficiency

🧠 How Beam Search Works
Begins at the start node.

Evaluates all immediate neighbors.

Selects the top k neighbors with the lowest heuristic values.

Explores only those k nodes at the next level.

Repeats the process until:

The goal node is found, or

The graph is exhausted

🔁 Important: Nodes outside the top-k are pruned permanently, meaning the algorithm may miss the optimal path.

🪜 Step-by-Step Execution
Initialize open list with the start node and its heuristic.

While open list is not empty:

Pick and expand the top-k nodes with best heuristic values.

Add their neighbors (if unvisited) to the open list.

Prune the open list to retain only the best k nodes.

Repeat until the goal is reached.

Return the visited path leading to the goal.

🌍 Applications of Beam Search
🤖 Speech Recognition (e.g., decoding best phoneme sequence)

✨ Natural Language Processing (machine translation, parsing)

🔎 Autocomplete & Predictive Typing

🎮 Game AI (rapid path prediction)

🧠 Heuristic Search in large or infinite graphs

⏱️ Time & Space Complexity
Type	Complexity
⏳ Time	O(b^k) — b: branching factor, k: depth
💾 Space	O(b) — stores only top-k nodes per level

⚠️ Trade-off:
Beam Search is faster and more memory-efficient, but may miss the globally optimal path due to aggressive pruning.
