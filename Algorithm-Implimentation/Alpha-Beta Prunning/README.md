♟️ Alpha-Beta Pruning Algorithm in Game Trees
This project implements the Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithm — a powerful optimization technique applied to the Minimax algorithm. It smartly prunes parts of the game tree that don’t affect the final decision, resulting in a faster and more efficient strategy without compromising on the optimality of results.

🚀 About This Algorithm
Alpha-Beta Pruning is a depth-first search technique used in two-player zero-sum games, such as chess or tic-tac-toe. It significantly reduces the number of nodes evaluated by the Minimax algorithm by pruning branches that are guaranteed not to influence the final decision.

✅ Minimax ensures optimal strategy.

✅ Alpha-Beta boosts efficiency by avoiding unnecessary computation.

🧠 How Alpha-Beta Pruning Works
The algorithm recursively explores a game tree by alternating turns between:

Maximizing Player – aims to maximize the score

Minimizing Player – aims to minimize the score

Two key parameters are maintained:

Parameter	Role
🔺 alpha	Best maximum score the maximizer can guarantee so far
🔻 beta	Best minimum score the minimizer can guarantee so far

🔒 Pruning Condition:
If at any point beta ≤ alpha, the current branch is pruned — i.e., further exploration is stopped, as it won’t affect the final decision.

🪜 Step-by-Step Algorithm Flow
Start from the root node (e.g., game state A).

Recursively evaluate child nodes by alternating between max and min player logic.

Update alpha and beta as better options are discovered.

Prune branches where beta ≤ alpha to save computation.

Return the optimal value for the root node once all relevant branches are evaluated.

🌍 Applications of Alpha-Beta Pruning
♟️ Chess Engines (like Stockfish, Deep Blue)

🃏 Board Games (e.g., Tic-Tac-Toe, Checkers)

🤖 Two-Player AI Agents

🎮 Minimax Optimization in strategic games

🔬 Game Theory Simulations

⏱️ Time & Space Complexity
Type	Complexity
⏳ Time	O(b^(m/2)) — where b = branching factor, m = depth
💾 Space	O(m) — proportional to the maximum depth of tree

🎯 Efficiency Boost:
Alpha-Beta pruning can search twice as deep as Minimax alone — using the same computational power.
