# 🎮 Tic Tac Toe (with AI using DFS/BFS)

This is a simple browser-based Tic Tac Toe game implemented using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It features a basic AI opponent that plays as `O` using either **Depth-First Search (DFS)** or **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** to decide its moves.

## 🧠 How the AI Works

- The AI plays as **Player O**.
- By default, it uses **DFS (Depth-First Search)** to find the first available move.
- To switch to **BFS (Breadth-First Search)**, update the `script.js` file:

```js
// Inside aiMove() function:
// const moveIndex = findAIMoveDFS();
const moveIndex = findAIMoveBFS(); // Uncomment this to enable BFS
```
