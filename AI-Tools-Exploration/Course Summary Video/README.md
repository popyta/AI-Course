Hi, I’m Popy Talukdar, a Computer Science & Engineering student at North East University Bangladesh.

Over the past six months, I have explored the fascinating field of Artificial Intelligence through my course, CSE-412.

I implemented key algorithms such as A*, AO*, Minimax, Alpha-Beta Pruning, and others — each of which helped me understand how machines can make intelligent decisions.

Additionally, I developed AI-based games including Tic Tac Toe, Chess, and candy-crush-master, where I applied search algorithms and decision-making logic to simulate intelligent behavior.

Using AI tools like Pictory, Canva, and Designs.AI, I also created presentations and videos to creatively demonstrate and share my learning outcomes.

Under the guidance of Razorshi Prozzwal Talukder, this course effectively combined theoretical knowledge with practical applications, strengthening my confidence in developing intelligent systems.
